the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B

set-builder notation: A × B = {(a,b) | a ∈ A and b ∈ B}
	
a table can be created by taking the Cartesian product of a set of rows and a set of columns. If the Cartesian product _rows_ × _columns_ is taken, the cells of the table contain ordered pairs of the form (row value, column value):

the Cartesian product of n sets, called an n-fold Cartesian product, can be represented by an n-dimensional array, where each element is an n-[tuple](notes/tuple.md).
